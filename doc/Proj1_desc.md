The goal of this project is to write a data story on philosophy using the dataset for the [Philosophy Data Project](http://philosophydata.com/index.html). Applying data mining, statistical analysis and visualization, students should derive interesting findings in this collection of philosophy texts and write a "data story" that can be shared with a **general audience**. 


This project is conducted by Yunfan Liu
